# Real Estate Landing Page

This project is a real estate landing page focused on the concept of co-ownership. It was built using Next.js 14, Recharts, and Chakra UI. Through the development of this landing page, I gained valuable experience with Next.js and enhanced my proficiency in using Recharts for data visualization. Additionally, I improved my skills as a developer by resolving build errors encountered during deployment on Vercel.
